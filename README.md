Is this for you
===================
NO. This is for me. Unless you are comfortable with writing a bit of python code. Then yes. At some point in the future this might evolve to something appropriate for wider audiences, but at the moment it's just a script that helps me to save time (yeah, right http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png)

What is this?
===================

A solution integrating uTorrent, Plex media server and torrent search. Lets you download your media from a torrent network in two clicks.

Dependecies
===================
You will need at least utorrent web ui running for this to work. I use plex media server to view the media later, but it doesnt interact with meadiaBam yet, so it's not required

Installation
===================
- Open tpb.config, server.config and utorrent.config in a text editor and set the desire settings.
- run 'python server.py' in the mediaBam directory
- If you can't access it from another machine - make sure that the port is open on your firewall/antivirus.
