What is this?
===================

A solution integrating uTorrent, Plex media server and torrent search. Lets you downiload your media from a torrent network in two clicks.

Dependecies
===================
You will need at least utorrent web ui running for this to work. I use plex media server to view the media later, but it doesnt interact with meadiaBam yet, so it's not required

Installation
===================
- Open tpb.config, server.config and utorrent.config in a text editor and set the desire settings.
- run 'python server.py' in the mediaBam directory
- If you can't access it from another machine - make sure that the port is open on your firewall/antivirus.
